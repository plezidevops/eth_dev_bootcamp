# On becoming a blockchain developer

I decided to work on this learning just for fun. By the end of this learning I am a proficient blockchain developer, capable of designing and architecting any blockchain application. To prove my capability to myself, I have designing and coding an application from scratch that solve land ownership problems in countries like Haiti. So becoming a blockchain architect/developer is a journey. My entire 2023 is devoted to blockchain technologies. I am learning something about blockchain everyday. Learning is fun, why not keep on learning. I am hoping to use this experience and teach others. Teaching is great way to advance humanity!!!

- My goal is to program every single day, rain or not.

## Day-01 03/10/2023

### **Topic** Developing with Remix - Intro

### **The focus**

- Getting to know remix IDE
- writing my first smart contract
- Stopping and interacting with smart contracts
- Compile smart contract
- Read and write to smart contract

### **The learning**

I have been reading about the blockchain a lot. Reading and doing are the same thing. Doing really cement the stuff the stuff you been reading about. In today's lesson I got to see the make up of a transaction. Transaction that write stuff to the blockchain cost money or gas fees. Transaction that read stuff from the blockchain is free. Transactions are deployed to specific address on the blockchain.

### **Topic** Solidity getting to the language

### **The focus**

- Different type of Variables solidity supports
- Constructor
- Understanding storage, memory, stack
- Understanding the concept of state

### **The learning**

Today's learning is pretty fun. The learning focus in solidity fundamental. I learned the theory of smart contract from compilation to deployment. I really now understand the concept of state and its impact on the smart contract. A poorly written smart contract will cost you gas. I also learned about the constructor and its purpose. I wrote codes to play around with language and ciment my understanding of the concepts. Keep learning!!! Keep practicing!!!

## Day-03 03/12/2023

### **Topic** Solidity Fundamental part2

### **The focus**
- Types: string, address, boolean, integer, if-statement, functions
- creating the messenger smart contract

### **The learning**
To day I cover lots of stuff with lots of hands-on practice. At the end I created a smart contract that keeps tracks of messages. Anyone can read the message, but only the address that deploys the smart contract can update messages. Also the contract is able to inform callers the number of times message in the smart contract updated. I had a rough time understanding contract addresses. In the end I nailed it. Keep up the learning chief!!!
